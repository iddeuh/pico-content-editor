# PHP Quill Renderer

*Render quill insert deltas to HTML.*

## Description

Quill deltas renderer, converts deltas to HTML, the attributes supported by version 1.00.0 are listed below. 
Version 2.00.0 is in development, I'm working on support for additional Quill attributes, markdown support and a 
full rewrite of the parser, version 2.00.0 will only support PHP7+. 

Created for use within [Dlayer](https://github.com/Dlayer/dlayer) but works as a stand-alone tool.

## Installation
 
The easiest way to use the renderer is with composer. ```composer require deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer```, 
alternatively include the classes in src/ in your library.
 
## Usage
```
try {
    $quill = new \DBlackborough\Quill\Render($deltas, 'HTML');
    echo $quill->render();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Usage, direct, parse and then render
```
$parser = new \DBlackborough\Quill\Parser\Html();
$parser->load($deltas);
$parser->parse();

$renderer = new \DBlackborough\Quill\Renderer\Html($parser->content());
echo $renderer->render();
```

## Options
The HTML tag to use for Quill attributes can be set along with the HTML tags for the container.
 
### Default options

Separator | HTML Tag
--- | --- 
Container | `<p>`

#### Default attribute options

Quill Attribute | HTML Tag
--- | --- 
Bold | `<strong>`
Italic | `<em>`
Link | `<a>`
Strike | `<s>`
Script:Sub | `<sub>`
Script:Super | `<sup>`
Underline | `<u>`
Header | `<h[n]>`
Image | `<img>`
List | `<ul>` `<ol>`

## Warnings

### Image support

The image support is rudimentary; it isn't production ready, some work needs to be done to support 
images. I can think of two solutions, pre-save of deltas, post the base64 and return a URI to replace the 
base64, or, at render time, fetch/cache an image/URI by posting the base64, later down the line I may 
explore one of these options.

Why? 

I'm using this package within Dlayer, my app has its own image handling and I will not be exposing 
the image functionality of Quill.
